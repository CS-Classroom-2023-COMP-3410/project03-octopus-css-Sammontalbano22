In general I found this assignment both fun and challenging to do. The vast majority of the code I was able to mimic the screenshot with outside of a few color options but I attribute that to my terrible color matching skills. However, i got stuck in one place in particular. The OCTOPUS QUIZ I was able to creat the box and push the image to the center right, however, for the life of me I can not figure out how to get the form under the header element. It feels like it should be automatically doing it or manageble, but only if I could change the html.

This assignment, felt like good practice for drilling in my css skills, however, it did not help us with responsive design since we were trying to only mimic the screenshot and not thing about practicality.
